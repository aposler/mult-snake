#Alex Osler Proposal
Summary: I am proposing a multiplayer snake-like game where users can steal the tails of opposing snakes, with the end goal of configuring their snake into a certain pre-decided shape.

Details: Between 10-20 players will all interact on a fixed size grid, which functions similarly to snake. There will be randomly generated pellets that will allow users to, slowly, increase the size of their snake. Additionally, if a user makes contact with the tail of an opposing snake, they will "eat" the tail of that snake, and add all the blocks including and below the eaten block to their tail. Their will be 2 modes, one endless one where the only goal is to be snake with the longest tail, and a mode with a defined ending. This second mode will generate a semi-random shape that a snake can mold themselves into by moving. The end goal will be to have the same or more blocks as this required shape, and to mold your snake into it.

Demonstrations:
Here is how a snake would steal the tail of another snake
